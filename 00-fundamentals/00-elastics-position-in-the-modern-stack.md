# Elasticsearch's Position in the Modern Stack

## The Central Platform for Search, AI, and Observability

Understanding where Elasticsearch fits in modern application architectures is crucial for making informed technology decisions. Unlike traditional databases or search engines that serve single purposes, Elasticsearch has evolved into a central platform that unifies multiple use cases while maintaining the performance and scale requirements of each.

## 🏗️ The Architecture Evolution

### Traditional Siloed Architecture

**The old way:** Separate systems for separate problems

```
Application Layer
├── MySQL (Transactional data)
├── Redis (Caching)
├── Solr (Search)
├── InfluxDB (Metrics)
├── Splunk (Logs)
├── Weaviate (Vectors)
└── Various ML platforms

```

**Problems with this approach:**

- Data duplication across systems
- Complex integration and synchronisation
- Operational complexity multiplied by number of systems
- Inconsistent query languages and APIs
- High total cost of ownership

### Modern Unified Architecture

**The Elasticsearch way:** One platform, multiple use cases

```
Application Layer
└── Elasticsearch Cluster
    ├── Search indices (Product catalog, content)
    ├── Observability data (Logs, metrics, traces)
    ├── Vector stores (Embeddings, ML models)
    ├── Security data (Events, alerts, investigations)
    └── AI/ML processing (Inference, training)

```

**Benefits of unification:**

- Single source of truth for multiple data types
- Consistent APIs and query language
- Simplified operational overhead
- Better resource utilisation
- Faster development cycles

## 📊 Sizing and Capacity Planning

### Resource Planning Framework

**Step 1: Understand your workload**

| Workload Type | Characteristics | Resource Priorities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Search-heavy** | High query volume, complex aggregations | CPU, memory for caching |
| **Ingest-heavy** | High write volume, bulk operations | I/O bandwidth, indexing resources |
| **Analytics** | Large dataset scans, complex queries | Memory, storage capacity |
| **Real-time** | Low latency requirements | SSD storage, network |

**Step 2: Calculate resource requirements**

```
Storage = (Raw data size × Replication factor × Index overhead) × Growth factor
Memory = (Working set × JVM heap) + (OS cache × Active indices)
CPU = (Query complexity × Concurrent users) + (Indexing load × Ingestion rate)

```

**Step 3: Plan for growth**

- Monitor usage patterns and growth rates
- Design for 3x current requirements
- Plan scaling trigger points
- Consider seasonal variations

### Performance Benchmarking

**Key metrics to track:**

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Target Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Search performance** | Query latency P95, throughput | <100ms, >1000 QPS |
| **Indexing performance** | Ingestion rate, indexing latency | Match source rate, <1s |
| **Resource utilisation** | CPU, memory, disk I/O | <80% sustained |
| **Cluster health** | Shard allocation, node availability | 100% green time |
