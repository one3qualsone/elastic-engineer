## 🎯 The Three Pillars of Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch isn't just a search engine - it's the foundation for three major application categories:

| Use Case | Primary Goal | Data Characteristics | User Patterns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **🔍 Search** | Find relevant information | Relatively static content | Human users exploring |
| **📊 Observability** | Monitor system health | High-volume time series | Dashboards and alerts |
| **🔒 Security** | Detect threats and incidents | Security events and logs | Investigation and response |

**Why this matters:** Each use case drives different architectural decisions, data modeling approaches, and query patterns.

## 🔍 Search Applications: Finding Information

### Characteristics of Search Use Cases

**Primary goal:** Help users find relevant information from a collection of documents.

**Typical applications:**

- E-commerce product catalogs
- Enterprise knowledge bases
- Website search
- Document management systems
- FAQ and help systems

**Data patterns:**

| Aspect | Search Applications |
| --- | --- |
| **Data volume** | Moderate (thousands to millions of documents) |
| **Update frequency** | Low to moderate (daily/weekly updates) |
| **Data structure** | Rich, varied document structures |
| **Query complexity** | Complex relevance-based queries |
| **Response time** | Sub-second for user experience |

### Search-Specific Design Patterns

**Document modeling for search:**

- **Rich metadata:** Store all searchable attributes in each document
- **Denormalization:** Avoid joins by including related data
- **Full-text content:** Store complete searchable text
- **Faceting support:** Include categorical fields for filtering

**Example - Product Catalog Document:**

```json
{
  "product_id": "SKU-12345",
  "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
  "description": "Premium noise-cancelling headphones...",
  "brand": "SoundTech",
  "category": "Electronics > Audio > Headphones",
  "price": 199.99,
  "features": ["noise-cancelling", "wireless", "bluetooth"],
  "reviews": {
    "average_rating": 4.5,
    "review_count": 127,
    "recent_reviews": ["Great sound quality", "Comfortable fit"]
  },
  "availability": {
    "in_stock": true,
    "warehouse_locations": ["US-WEST", "US-EAST"]
  }
}

```

**Query patterns for search:**

- **Relevance-focused:** Results ranked by how well they match user intent
- **Faceted search:** Users filter by category, price, brand, etc.
- **Auto-complete:** Real-time suggestions as users type
- **Recommendation:** "Similar products" or "people also viewed"

**Performance considerations:**

- **Index optimization:** Analyze text fields appropriately for search
- **Relevance tuning:** Boost important fields (title > description > content)
- **Caching:** Cache frequent searches and facet counts
- **Personalization:** Customize results based on user preferences

### Search Example: E-commerce Query

**User searches:** "wireless noise cancelling headphones under $300"

**Query breakdown:**

1. **Text matching:** "wireless", "noise", "cancelling", "headphones"
2. **Price filter:** price <= 300
3. **Relevance scoring:** Boost exact phrase matches, brand popularity
4. **Facets:** Show brand, price range, rating breakdowns

**Elasticsearch implementation:**

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "multi_match": {
            "query": "wireless noise cancelling headphones",
            "fields": ["name^3", "description^2", "features^2"]
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {"range": {"price": {"lte": 300}}},
        {"term": {"availability.in_stock": true}}
      ]
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "brands": {"terms": {"field": "brand.keyword"}},
    "price_ranges": {"range": {"field": "price", "ranges": [...]}}
  }
}

```

## 📊 Observability Applications: Monitoring Systems

### Characteristics of Observability Use Cases

**Primary goal:** Monitor system health, detect issues, and analyze performance trends.

**Typical applications:**

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Metrics dashboards
- Alerting systems

**Data patterns:**

| Aspect | Observability Applications |
| --- | --- |
| **Data volume** | Very high (millions to billions of events daily) |
| **Update frequency** | Continuous real-time ingestion |
| **Data structure** | Structured time-series events |
| **Query complexity** | Time-based aggregations and filtering |
| **Response time** | Fast dashboards, real-time alerts |

### Observability-Specific Design Patterns

**Document modeling for observability:**

- **Time-centric:** Every document has a timestamp
- **Structured fields:** Consistent field naming across services
- **Metric extraction:** Pre-compute common aggregation values
- **Retention-aware:** Design for automatic data lifecycle management

**Example - Application Log Document:**

```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "service": {
    "name": "user-authentication",
    "version": "2.1.4",
    "environment": "production"
  },
  "host": {
    "name": "auth-server-03",
    "ip": "10.0.1.23"
  },
  "log": {
    "level": "ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to authenticate user",
    "logger": "AuthController"
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "user_12345",
    "session_id": "sess_abc123"
  },
  "http": {
    "request": {
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "/api/v1/login"
    },
    "response": {
      "status_code": 401,
      "duration_ms": 245
    }
  },
  "error": {
    "type": "InvalidCredentialsException",
    "stack_trace": "..."
  }
}

```

**Query patterns for observability:**

- **Time-based filtering:** Show data for specific time ranges
- **Aggregations over time:** Count errors per minute, average response time
- **Anomaly detection:** Identify unusual patterns in metrics
- **Correlation analysis:** Find relationships between different metrics

**Performance considerations:**

- **Hot-warm-cold architecture:** Move older data to cheaper storage
- **Index lifecycle management:** Automatically manage data retention
- **Rollup aggregations:** Pre-compute common time-based aggregations
- **Sampling:** Reduce data volume while maintaining statistical accuracy

### Observability Example: Error Rate Dashboard

**Business question:** "What's our error rate over the last 24 hours, broken down by service?"

**Query requirements:**

1. **Time filter:** Last 24 hours
2. **Error identification:** HTTP status >= 400 OR log.level = "ERROR"
3. **Grouping:** By service name and time buckets
4. **Calculation:** Error rate = errors / total requests

**Elasticsearch implementation:**

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        {"range": {"@timestamp": {"gte": "now-24h"}}},
        {"bool": {
          "should": [
            {"range": {"http.response.status_code": {"gte": 400}}},
            {"term": {"log.level": "ERROR"}}
          ]
        }}
      ]
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "services": {
      "terms": {"field": "service.name.keyword"},
      "aggs": {
        "over_time": {
          "date_histogram": {
            "field": "@timestamp",
            "fixed_interval": "1h"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## 🔒 Security Applications: Threat Detection

### Characteristics of Security Use Cases

**Primary goal:** Detect security threats, investigate incidents, and maintain compliance.

**Typical applications:**

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Threat hunting and investigation
- Fraud detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Incident response

**Data patterns:**

| Aspect | Security Applications |
| --- | --- |
| **Data volume** | High (security events from many sources) |
| **Update frequency** | Real-time (immediate threat detection) |
| **Data structure** | Mixed (logs, network data, user activities) |
| **Query complexity** | Complex correlation and pattern matching |
| **Response time** | Immediate alerts, detailed investigation queries |

### Security-Specific Design Patterns

**Document modeling for security:**

- **Event normalization:** Standardize events from different sources
- **Enrichment:** Add threat intelligence and contextual data
- **Correlation keys:** Include fields that enable event correlation
- **Evidence preservation:** Maintain complete audit trails

**Example - Security Event Document:**

```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "event": {
    "category": "authentication",
    "type": "failed_login",
    "outcome": "failure",
    "severity": "medium"
  },
  "user": {
    "name": "john.smith",
    "id": "12345",
    "roles": ["employee"],
    "department": "engineering"
  },
  "source": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "geo": {
      "country": "US",
      "city": "San Francisco"
    },
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
  },
  "destination": {
    "service": "corporate-vpn",
    "ip": "10.0.1.50"
  },
  "threat": {
    "indicators": ["suspicious_ip", "off_hours_access"],
    "risk_score": 75
  },
  "raw_log": "Jan 15 10:30:45 vpn-server: Authentication failed for user john.smith from 192.168.1.100"
}

```

**Query patterns for security:**

- **Rule-based detection:** Match known attack patterns
- **Behavioral analysis:** Detect deviations from normal patterns
- **Correlation analysis:** Link related events across time
- **Investigation queries:** Deep-dive into specific incidents

**Performance considerations:**

- **Real-time alerting:** Sub-second detection for critical threats
- **Long-term storage:** Retain data for compliance and investigation
- **Search performance:** Fast queries during incident response
- **Data enrichment:** Augment events with threat intelligence

### Security Example: Lateral Movement Detection

**Security question:** "Detect potential lateral movement - users accessing multiple systems in rapid succession"

**Detection logic:**

1. **Find authentication events** across multiple systems
2. **Group by user** within a time window
3. **Count distinct systems** accessed
4. **Alert if threshold exceeded** (>5 systems in 10 minutes)

**Elasticsearch implementation:**

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        {"range": {"@timestamp": {"gte": "now-10m"}}},
        {"term": {"event.category": "authentication"}},
        {"term": {"event.outcome": "success"}}
      ]
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "users": {
      "terms": {"field": "user.name.keyword"},
      "aggs": {
        "unique_systems": {
          "cardinality": {"field": "destination.service.keyword"}
        },
        "alert_condition": {
          "bucket_selector": {
            "buckets_path": {"unique_systems": "unique_systems"},
            "script": "params.unique_systems > 5"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## 🔄 Cross-Cutting Patterns and Hybrid Use Cases

### When Use Cases Overlap

Many real-world applications combine elements from multiple use cases:

**Example: E-commerce Security**

- **Search component:** Product catalog and customer search
- **Observability component:** Monitor site performance and user behavior
- **Security component:** Detect fraud and abuse

**Example: Enterprise Knowledge Platform**

- **Search component:** Find documents and experts
- **Observability component:** Track search usage and performance
- **Security component:** Monitor access to sensitive documents

### Shared Technical Patterns

**Multi-tenant architecture:**

- **Search:** Different product catalogs per customer
- **Observability:** Separate environments (dev/staging/prod)
- **Security:** Isolated data per organization

**Real-time vs batch processing:**

- **Search:** Batch updates for catalog changes
- **Observability:** Real-time ingestion for monitoring
- **Security:** Real-time for alerts, batch for investigations

**Data retention strategies:**

- **Search:** Keep current versions, archive old ones
- **Observability:** Hot-warm-cold with automatic deletion
